# Naming Conventions

## Principles

* Prefer lowercase, hyphen‑separated file names.
* Use descriptive, concise names.
* Avoid ambiguous abbreviations.

## Go-Specific

* Packages: short, meaningful (e.g., `auth`, `config`).
* Variables: camelCase.
* Constants: PascalCase if exported, camelCase otherwise.

## Repo-Level

* Keep naming consistent across repos.
