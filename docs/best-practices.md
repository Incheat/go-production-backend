# Best Practices

## General Development

* Keep functions small and focused.
* Write tests for core logic.
* Use linters (e.g., `golangci-lint`).

## Go Project Practices

* Prefer composition over inheritance.
* Return errors, don't panic.
* Use contexts for cancellations/timeouts.

## Repository Practices

* Keep documentation updated.
* Follow consistent commit format.
* Tag releases for versioning.
